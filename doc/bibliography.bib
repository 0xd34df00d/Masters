  abstract	= {Symbolic regression via genetic programming (GP) was used
		  in the optimisation of a pharmaceutical zero-order release
		  matrix tablet, and its predictive performance was compared
		  to that of artificial neural network (ANN) models. Two
		  types of GP algorithms were employed: 1) standard GP, where
		  a single population is used with a restricted or an
		  extended function set, and 2) multi-population (island
		  model) GP, where a finite number of populations is adopted.
		  The amounts of four polymers, namely PEG4000, PVP K30, HPMC
		  K100 and HPMC E50LV were selected as independent variables,
		  while the percentage of nimodipine released in 2 and 8 h
		  (Y2h, and Y8h), respectively, and the time at which 90% of
		  the drug was dissolved (t90%), were selected as responses.
		  Optimal models were selected by minimisation of the
		  Euclidian distance between predicted and optimum release
		  parameters. It was found that the prediction ability of GP
		  on an external validation set was higher compared to that
		  of the ANNs, with the multi population and standard GP
		  combined with an extended function set, showing slightly
		  better predictive performance. Similarity factor (f2)
		  values confirmed GP's increased prediction performance for
		  multi-population GP (f2 = 85.52) and standard GP using an
		  extended function set (f2 = 84.47).},

  abstract	= {Most computer algebra systems incorrectly simplify (z -
		  z)/(sqrt(w^2)/w^3 - 1/(w*sqrt(w^2))) to 0 rather than to
		  0/0. The reasons for this are: 1. The default
		  simplification doesn't succeed in simplifying the
		  denominator to 0. 2. There is a rule that 0 is the result
		  of 0 divided by anything that doesn't simplify to either 0
		  or 0/0. Try it on your computer algebra systems! This
		  article describes how to simplify products of the form
		  w^a*(w^b1)^g1 ... (w^bn)^gn correctly and well, where w is
		  any real or complex expression and the exponents are
		  rational numbers. It might seem that correct good
		  simplification of such a restrictive expression class must
		  already be published and/or built into at least one widely
		  used computer-algebra system, but apparently this issue has
		  been overlooked. Default and relevant optional
		  simplification was tested with 86 examples for n=1 on
		  Derive, Maple, Mathematica, Maxima and TI-CAS. Totaled over
		  all five systems, 11% of the results were not equivalent to
		  the input everywhere, 50% of the results did not simplify
		  to 0 a result that was equivalent to 0, and at least 16% of
		  the results exhibited one or more of four additional flaw
		  types. There was substantial room for improvement in all
		  five systems, including the two for which I was a
		  co-author. The good news is: These flaws are easy to fix.},

		  for code growth in genetic programming, and shows how an
		  understanding of these pressures can be used to use to
		  eliminate code growth while simultaneously improving
		  performance. We begin with a discussion of two distinct
		  components of code growth and the extent to which each
		  component is relevant in practice. We then define the
		  concept of resilience in GP trees, and show that the
		  buildup of resilience is essential for code growth. We
		  present simple modifications to the selection procedures
		  used by GP that eliminate bloat without hurting
		  performance. Finally, we show that eliminating bloat can
		  improve the performance of genetic programming by a factor
		  that increases as the problem is scaled in difficulty.},
